	<h3><a href="https://bible.com/bible/1588/psa.69.32-33.AMP">PSALMS 69:32‭-‬33 AMP</a></h3> 
    <p>The humble have seen it and are glad;
You who seek God <em>[requiring Him as your greatest need]</em>, let your heart revive and live. For the Lord hears the needy And does not despise His who are prisoners.
    </p>
    <h3><a href="https://bible.com/bible/1588/psa.70.4.AMP">PSALMS 70:4 AMP</a></h3>
    <p>May all those who seek You [as life’s first priority] rejoice and be glad in You; May those who love Your salvation say continually, “Let God be magnified!”
    </p>
    <h3><a href="https://bible.com/bible/1588/psa.71.1-3.AMP">PSALMS 71:1‭-‬3 AMP
</a></h3>
    <p><em>In you</em>, O Lord , I have put my trust and <em>confidently</em> taken refuge; Let me never be put to shame. In Your righteousness deliver me and rescue me; Incline Your ear to me and save me. Be to me a rock of refuge and a sheltering stronghold to which I may <em>continually</em> come; You have given the commandment to save me, For You are my rock and my fortress.
    </p>
    <h3><a href="https://bible.com/bible/1588/psa.73.22-28.AMP">PSALMS 73:22‭-‬25‭, ‬28 AMP</a></h3>
    <p>Then I was senseless and ignorant; I was like a beast before You. Nevertheless I am continually with You; You have taken hold of my right hand. You will guide me with Your counsel, And afterward receive me to honor and glory. Whom have I in heaven [but You]? And besides You, I desire nothing on earth. But as for me, it is good for me to draw near to God; I have made the Lord God my refuge and placed my trust in Him, That I may tell of all Your works.
    </p>
    <h3><a href="https://bible.com/bible/1588/psa.75.6-7.AMP">PSALMS 75:6‭-‬7 AMP</a></h3>
    <p>For not from the east, nor from the west, Nor from the desert comes exaltation. But God is the Judge; He puts down one and lifts up another.</p>
    </p>
    <h3><a href="https://bible.com/bible/1588/psa.76.7.AMP">PSALMS 76:7 AMP</a></h3>
    <p>You, even You, are to be feared [with the submissive wonder of reverence]; Who may stand in Your presence when once You are angry?</p>

</p>
    <h3><a href="https://bible.com/bible/1588/psa.78.1.AMP">PSALMS 78:1 AMP</a></h3>
    <p>Listen, O my people, to my teaching; <i>Incline your ears to the words of my mouth [and be willing to learn].</i></p>
    <h3><a href="https://bible.com/bible/1588/psa.78.7-8.AMP">PSALMS 78:7‭-‬8 AMP</a></h3>
    <p>That they should <em>place their confidence in God And not forget the works of God,</em> But keep His commandments, And not be like their fathers-- A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that did not <em>prepare its heart to know and follow God,</em> And whose spirit was not faithful to God.
    </p>
    <h3><a href="https://bible.com/bible/1588/psa.78.21-22.AMP">PSALMS 78:21‭-‬22 AMP</a></h3>
    <p>Therefore, when the Lord heard, He was full of wrath; A fire was kindled against Jacob, And His anger mounted up against Israel, Because they did not believe in God <em>[they did not rely on Him, they did not adhere to Him], And they did not trust in His salvation (His power to save).</em>
