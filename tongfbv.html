        <p>Come, you children, listen to me; I will teach you to fear the Lord [with awe-inspired reverence and worship Him with obedience]. Who is the man who desires life And loves many days, that he may see good? Keep your tongue from evil And your lips from speaking deceit. Turn away from evil and do good; Seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous [those with moral courage and spiritual integrity] And His ears are open to their cry.</br>

          <p>“Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad; for the tree is recognized and judged by its fruit.</br>  You brood of vipers, how can you speak good things when you are evil? For the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart.</br>  The good man, from his [inner] good treasure, brings out good things; and the evil man, from his [inner] evil treasure, brings out evil things.</br>  <strong>But I tell you, on the day of judgment people will have to give an accounting for every careless or useless word they speak.</strong></br>  For by your words [reflecting your spiritual condition] you will be justified and acquitted of the guilt of sin; and by your words [rejecting Me] you will be condemned and sentenced.”</br>
