    <p class="bg-info">For physical training is of some value, but godliness (spiritual training) is of value in everything and in every way, since it holds promise for the present life and for the life to come. This is a faithful and trustworthy saying worthy of full acceptance and approval.

    <p class="bg-info">If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with <em>the doctrine and teaching which is in agreement with godliness (personal integrity, upright behavior),</em> he is conceited and woefully ignorant [understanding nothing].</br> He has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, which produces envy, quarrels, verbal abuse, evil suspicions, and perpetual friction between men who are corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth, <em>who think that godliness is a source of profit [a lucrative, money-making business--withdraw from them].</em> But godliness actually is a source of great gain when accompanied by contentment [that contentment which comes from a sense of inner confidence based on the sufficiency of God]. For we have brought nothing into the world, so [it is clear that] we cannot take anything out of it, either. But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content.

For the love of money [that is, the greedy desire for it and the willingness to gain it unethically] is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves [through and through] with many sorrows.
