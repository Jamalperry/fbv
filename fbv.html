    <h3><a href="https://bible.com/bible/1588/rom.12.1.AMP">ROMANS 12:1 AMP</a></h3>
    <p>Therefore I<em> urge</em> you, brothers and sisters,</br>
<em>by the mercies of God</em>, to present your bodies</br>
[dedicating all of yourselves, set apart]</br>
as a <em>living sacrifice</em>, holy and well-pleasing to God,</br>
which is your rational (logical, intelligent)<em> act of worship</em>.</br>
    </p>
    <h3><a href="https://bible.com/bible/1588/psa.69.32-33.AMP">PSALMS 69:32‭-‬33 AMP</a></h3> 
    <p>The humble have seen it and are glad;</br>
You who seek God <em>[requiring Him as your greatest need]</em>,</br> let your heart revive and live. For the Lord hears the needy</br> And does not despise His who are prisoners.
