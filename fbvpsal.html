    <p>That they should <em>place their confidence in God And not forget the works of God,</em> But keep His commandments, And not be like their fathers-- A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that did not <em>prepare its heart to know and follow God,</em> And whose spirit was not faithful to God.

    <p>“Hear, O My people, and I will admonish you-- O Israel, if you would listen to Me! “Let there be no strange god among you, Nor shall you worship any foreign god. “I am the Lord your God, Who brought you up from the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide and I will fill it. “But My people would not listen to My voice, And Israel did not [consent to] obey Me. “So I gave them up to the stubbornness of their heart, To walk in [the path of] their own counsel. <em>“Oh, that My people would listen to Me,</em> That Israel would <em>walk in My ways!</em> “Then I would quickly subdue and humble their enemies And turn My hand against their adversaries; Those who hate the Lord would pretend obedience to Him and cringe before Him, And their time of punishment would be forever. “But I would feed Israel with the finest of the wheat; And with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.”
