    <p>Therefore I<em> urge</em> you, brothers and sisters,</br>
<em>by the mercies of God</em>, to present your bodies
[dedicating all of yourselves, set apart]
as a <em>living sacrifice</em>, holy and well-pleasing to God,
which is your rational (logical, intelligent)<em> act of worship</em>.
      </p>
